This repository contains the basic code required to create a client using [MCP-919](https://github.com/Marcelektro/MCP-919). The code was NOT written by me, but by [Eric Golde](https://github.com/egold555). However, some parts of the code have been modified for improvement purposes.

To use it, copy and paste `./lib/` and `./src/minecraft/` into your project.
